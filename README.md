# Large field-of-view non-invasive imaging through scattering layers using fluctuating random illumination

Codes and blueprints for the technique developed in:
Zhu, L., Soldevila, F., Moretti, C. et al. Large field-of-view non-invasive imaging through scattering layers using fluctuating random illumination. Nat Commun 13, 1447 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29166-y

We also provide an example dataset (dataset.m), but it needs to be downloaded separatelly (too big for github). It can be found here: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Speckle_imaging_dataset/15052155
You just need to put it in the same folder as the rest of the files.
